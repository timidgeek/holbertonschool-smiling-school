# Implement a design with Bootstrap :sparkles:

In this project at Holberton, we will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that we learned thus far.

We wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, we are free to implement it the way that we want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

## The three web pages are:
- [Homepage](https://www.figma.com/file/hcxMqRWjdj06jHycRkbzOf/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=hTKNeFlQbz4lAEol-0)
- [Pricing](https://www.figma.com/file/QQmdkH49hKJuJ6244fBXzH/Pricing?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=NYr8EOwtxwqcycAU-0)
- [Courses](https://www.figma.com/file/zKRy0vMRBjwHaKBn1WnavS/Courses?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=6a3fAEHWdMkZPALV-0)

## General Requirements:
- You have to use Bootstrap
- Your styles.css must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes
